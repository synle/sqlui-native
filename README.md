`sqlui-native` is a simple UI client for most SQL Engines written in Electron. It is compatible with most desktop OS's and support most dialects of RDBMS like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres, SQLite, Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, Azure CosmosDB and Azure Storage Table.

It supports multiple Windows, so you can have different sets of queries and connections side by side. The connections and queries are all stored locally, so you can continue where you left off in later visits.

## Features

### Overall Demo

![demo-full](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/151750703-419b66f2-938b-4edd-b852-97bfdfa12efd.gif)

### Import and Export

Import and Export can be used to share connections across different machines and users. Below is a sample import config.

```
[
  {
    "_type": "connection",
    "id": "connection.1643485516220.4798705129674932",
    "connection": "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432",
    "name": "sy postgres"
  },
  {
    "_type": "query",
    "id": "query.1643561715854.5278536054107370",
    "name": "Employee Query on Postgres",
    "sql": "SELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  employees\nLIMIT\n  10",
    "connectionId": "connection.1643485516220.4798705129674932",
    "databaseId": "music_store"
  }
]
```

You can also drag and drop the file directly into sqlui-native application. At the moment, we only support drag and drop for a single file.

### Session Management

This application supports multiple windows / instances. Sessions are used to control which instances it persist the data with.
Also these sessions, and the associated connections and queries are persisted locally. So you can continue where you left off in the future.

![demo-session](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/151750740-10ff3497-11b4-4026-bd39-c34b80bc1e3a.gif)

### Dark Mode

Dark mode will be turned on automatically with respect to your OS Preference. You can update settings to prefer Dark Mode or Light Mode if desired.

![demo-darkmode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/151746840-e4889ae1-cab9-4ade-b56b-5a4dbb654712.gif)

### Query Tabs

#### Query Tab Orientation

When there is more than 20 tabs, the query tabs will be wrapped vertically.

#### Reordering Query Tabs

Query tabs can be re-ordered by drag and drop the query tabs bar.

![tab-ordering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/153722628-ea28a940-e33a-4f66-983d-eb3e824e2a1c.gif)

#### Resizing the sidebar

The left sidebar can be resized by clicking and dragging the small section between the sidebar and the query box.

![sidebar-resize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/153722656-10529ff3-e818-4b6d-954c-7bdf57631d11.gif)

### Command Palette

Similar to VS Code and Sublime Text, sqlui-native comes with a command palette that lets you reach your mostly used command via a key combo `CMD + P` or `Ctrl + P` on Windows.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/152029205-5798c53d-6304-40dc-b9d8-11700bfc03f2.png)

### Connection Hints

Sample URI connection string can be accessed by clicking on the `Show Connection Hints` on New / Edit Connection Page. Then you can click on the sample URI connection to use that sample connection string as a starting place.

### Data Migration

If you happens to work with different database engine, there's a chance you want to move data from one engine to another engine. You can use `Data Migration` to craft a query to pull in data from the old engine and select a destination to generate the new schema / data for the new engine.

- `Data Migration` can be accessed from the top right hamburger icon
- From there, you have 2 options to migrate data. Either by a raw JSON or by data from an existing connection.

## Limitations

### sqlite Limitations

sqlite doesn't support multiple statements. So if you have multiple inserts or updates in a single query, it will not work. Refer to this [Stackoverflow post for more details related to sqlite](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609637/is-it-possible-to-insert-multiple-rows-at-a-time-in-an-sqlite-database).

If you want to do bulk inserts, use bulk inserts API instead.

```sql
INSERT INTO
  art (Name)
VALUES
  ('Queen'),
  ('Kiss'),
  ('Spyro Gyra')
```

### Cassandra Limitations

Cassandra Keyspaces are mapped to sqlui-native databases. And Cassandra Column Families are mapped to sqlui-native table.

### MongoDB Limitations

MongoDB Collections is mapped to sqlui-native table. We scan the first 5 Documents to come up with the schema for the columns.

#### Create new MongoDB Database

As of now (v1.27.0), you can create new mongodb using the following syntax

```js
db.createDatabase('new-database-name');
```

### Redis Limitations

Due to the size of keys within Redis connection, we will not show all keys in the Redis cache.

### Azure CosmosDB Limitations

Azure CosmosDB Databases are mapped to sqlui-native Databases. And Azure CosmosDB Containers are mapped to sqlui-native Tables. We scan the first 5 items to come up with the schema for the columns.

Tested for Azure CosmosDB (with Core SQL).

#### Setting up connection string

Here's how to set up the connection. Open your resource, and click on `Keys`. Then copy and use either `PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING` or `SECONDARY CONNECTION STRING`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/168092880-28d066ad-725f-429a-8ebf-92bb7f4f6d68.png)

Sample connection will look like this

```
cosmosdb://<your_primary_connection_string>

or

cosmosdb://<your_secondary_connection_string>
```

### Azure Table Storage Limitations

Azure Table Storage tables are mapped to sqlui-native Tables. We scan the first 5 items to come up with the schema for the columns.

#### Setting up connection string

Here's how to set up the connection.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792401/168092476-02b0ddb6-5cff-41fe-9b6a-8a212325999a.png)

Sample connection will look like this

```
aztable://<your_connection_string>
```
